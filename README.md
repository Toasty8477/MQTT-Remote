# MQTT-Remote

A simple MQTT controller for Home Assistant.  

## Reqirements

- An ESP8266 device, I'm using a Wemos D1 clone.
- A device running an mqtt broker like [mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/).  

## How to flash MicroPython

To run this program you will need to flsh micropython to your esp8266. You will need the [ESPHome Flasher](https://github.com/esphome/esphome-flasher/tree/master) and the latest [Micropython Firmware](https://micropython.org/download/esp8266/).
